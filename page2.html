    <section>this page and the main page were created for the exercises set in week 1 of the web programing module</section>
    <br>
    <div class="grid-container">
        <p class="grid-item1">the text on the main page was just the beginning of rick astley's "never gonna give you up" translated into different languages. <br>
            those languages being french, scottish gaelic, and dutch. french because i studied it at gcse, scottish gaelic because i want to learn it, and dutch because of a long distance friend.<br>
            sorry i just didn't know what to put as content on the page, but i wanted it to at least be something.</p>
        <p class="grid-item2">i decided to take that impulsive idea and ran with it, which leads to the text in the footer, and since i have no clue what to put in this text, i'll do the same for the final column of this page.<br>
            the design for this page is based on the stereotypical "code" always seen in tv and films. i just thought it would be funny, and it gave me a good theme to run with, so i kept it. that's why almost everything is in lower case.</p>
        <p class="grid-item3">We're no strangers to love<br>
            You know the rules and so do I (do I)<br>
            A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>
            You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br>
            I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
            Gotta make you understand<br>
            Never gonna give you up<br>
            Never gonna let you down<br>
            Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
            Never gonna make you cry<br>
            Never gonna say goodbye<br>
            Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <footer>we promise to never give you up, let you down, run around or desert you. 
    we will never make you cry, nor will we say goodbye, or even tell a lie and hurt you.</footer>
